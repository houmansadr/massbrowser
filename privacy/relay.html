                    <h4>Information we collect</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li> 
                          <strong>Unique Identifier:</strong>
                          When you use the MassBrowser Buddy software for the first time you will be assigned a unique random identifier (UID). The identifier is used by the MassBrowser service in multiple places.
                      </li>
                      <li> 
                        <strong>Content Type and Bandwidth Preferences:</strong>
                        MassBrowser collects and stores the website content type whitelist and bandwidth limits which are configured through the Buddy software’s user interface
                      </li>
                      <li> 
                        <strong>Session Details:</strong>
                        Every time a Client connects to the MassBrowser Buddy a new session will be created. The session details will be stored and associated with the UID of the Buddy.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>IP Address:</strong>
                          Buddy IP addresses will be collected every time the Buddy is run, however only the last IP address will be associated with the Buddy’s UID (i.e, MassBrowser will forget the Buddy’s IP address history).
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Buddy network bandwidth:</strong>
                        MassBrowser will keep record of the Buddy’s available bandwidth and internet proficiency This information will be associated to the Buddy's UID.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Network NAT information:</strong>
                          MassBrowser will collect information related to the NAT network a Buddy is behind, this information will be associated to the Buddy’s IP address but not it’s UID.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                      <h4>How we use information</h4>
                      <ul>
                        <li>MassBrowser uses the unique identifier (UID) to identify end users in the MassBrowser network. The UID is never associated with Personally Identifiable Information and is not shared with  third-party applications.</li>
                        <li>MassBrowser collects the non-anonymized IP address which the Buddy is connected with. The non-anonymized IP address is required for the Client to initiate a connection with the Buddy. MassBrowser will only store the latest IP address of the Buddy.</li>
                        <li>The Buddy’s preferences, network statistics, and network NAT information will be used to enhance the MassBrowser service by improving MassBrowser Client and Buddy matching process and identifying potentially malicious users. This information may also be used for research purposes. For such purposes, IP addresses will be anonymized and reported locations inferred from IP addresses will be no more accurate than city names.</li>
                      </ul>
